# IBM-CAPSTONE-PROJECT

🏥 Enhancing Operational Efficiency in a Multispecialty Hospital
IBM Business Analyst Capstone Project – Comprehensive Documentation & Analysis
📌 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on improving operational efficiency at Health First Care, a multispecialty hospital facing significant workflow, communication, and resource-related challenges.
The study consolidates Business Analysis deliverables—BRD, RTM, Stakeholder Analysis, Scope Plan, Process Models, Data Analysis, Risk Assessment, and Final Recommendations—to design a unified, data-driven solution for the hospital.

The final output includes a complete BA lifecycle: requirement gathering → stakeholder management → process mapping → analytics → risk mitigation → insights → recommendations.

🎯 2. Problem Statement

Health First Care suffers from:

Fragmented scheduling and record systems, leading to duplicate bookings, cancellations, and long wait times.

Inefficient resource allocation, including uneven staffing, equipment shortages, and supply gaps.

Outdated, unreliable technology, causing poor data access and system downtimes.

Communication breakdowns across departments affecting patient updates and workflow coordination.

Operational bottlenecks, resulting in patient dissatisfaction, staff burnout, and increased costs.

There is a critical need for an integrated, modern, digital hospital management system supported by analytics and automation.

🎯 3. Project Objectives

Streamline appointment scheduling through intuitive, real-time systems.

Reduce patient wait times with automation and timely communication.

Improve staff and equipment allocation using data-driven insights.

Enhance inter-department communication for seamless patient care.

Strengthen EHR accessibility, accuracy, and security.

Introduce analytics dashboards to monitor KPIs and operational performance.

🛠️ 4. Methodology & Approach
✔ Requirement Gathering

Using BRD + RTM

Defined business requirements

Identified constraints (budget, timelines, legacy systems, compliance)

Established acceptance criteria (99% uptime, <2s response time, 95% fewer scheduling errors)

✔ Stakeholder Analysis

Covering:

Patients

Doctors

Nurses

Admin staff

IT teams

With responsibility matrix, communication strategies, and engagement frequency.

✔ Scope Management

In-scope: Scheduling system, EHR, communication tools, resource management system, analytics platform
Out-of-scope: Hospital infrastructure upgrades, medical protocols, new equipment, marketing/training, long-term support

✔ Process Mapping

As-Is & To-Be models

Swimlane diagrams

Advanced process mapping for department-level workflows

✔ Data Analysis

Using appointment_data, feedback_data & resource_data

Key insights extracted:

Peak hours reveal staff shortages at specific times

Overbooked and underutilized doctors identified

Long wait times linked to particular departments

No-show/cancellation trends analyzed

Feedback scores reveal units with repeated communication issues

Equipment and rooms show inconsistent utilization

Resource shortages correlate with lower satisfaction and higher delays

✔ Visualization

Charts & dashboards highlighting:

Peak appointment hours

Satisfaction by department

Resource usage trends

No-show patterns

Wait-time analysis

✔ Risk Assessment & Mitigation

Risks include:

Downtime, data breaches, compliance failures

Staff resistance, training gaps

Resource shortages, scheduling failures

Poor analytics accuracy

Mitigation strategies:

Phased rollout & pilot testing

Backup systems & rapid incident response

User training & involvement in design

Continuous monitoring & improvement cycles

Strengthened security and compliance controls

📊 5. Key Findings
🔎 1. Fragmented Operations

Scheduling & records are non-integrated → causing errors, cancellations, long waits, and impaired workflows.

🔎 2. Poor Resource Utilization

Uneven nurse-to-patient ratios

Doctor overbooking

Equipment/supply shortages

High operational costs

🔎 3. Communication Gaps

Delayed updates

Missed notifications

Inefficient handovers

Outdated systems blocking data sharing

💡 6. Recommendations
1️⃣ Implement an Integrated Digital Health Platform

A unified system for appointments, records, communication, and workflows.

2️⃣ Enable Predictive Resource Allocation

Use analytics to forecast:

Staff demand

Equipment usage

Supply management

Peak hours and bottlenecks

3️⃣ Automate Communication

Automated reminders

Real-time delay notifications

Inter-department messaging tools

4️⃣ Upgrade Infrastructure

Replace legacy systems

Ensure interoperability

Improve uptime & data reliability

5️⃣ Continuous Improvement Cycle

Process audits

Staff feedback loops

Regular workflow optimization
